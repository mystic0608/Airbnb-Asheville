# Airbnb Asheville - Data Analysis with SQL and Tableau

As someone who is interested in data analysis, I sought after a dat aset and stumbled upon http://insideairbnb.com. This website provides dozens of data sets for many cities, including international. As I scrolled through, I found Asheville, NC on the list of data sets provided. At the time, I was planning a trip to visit Asheville and I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to explore the data and highlight some of the skills I have learned over the years.

# Data Exploration and Visually Appealing Insights

I dove into this project with a few things in mind - how can I utilize this data set and transform it into actionable insights? And how can I make those insights visually digestable? 

Firstly, I took these tables and did some cleaning. I mainly took several columns and removed them as they were not pertinent to my analysis. I double checked for any NULL values and found no duplicates. Fortunately, when you're working with a data set that isn't scraped from the web, you tend to be able to work with clean data sets - which is a crucial step in any analysis.

After exporting those tables into SQL server, I began exploring the data. What possible insights could I unravel with my SQL abilities? Knowing that I would have limited space on a Tableau dashboard, I settled with a few queries that may be the most beneficial from a business perspective:

* How many hosts have multiple listings?
